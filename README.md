This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## NOTE: In chrome on Mac, you may need to allow Chrome to access local files since we are loading local JSON data instead of using an API

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/food](http://localhost:3000/api/food). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/food.js`.
